## :scroll: Description

Whenever you want to play the game 30 seconds but don't trust the person controlling the hourglass.
This app will solve exactly _that_ issue. Start the timer and now exactly when the 30 seconds are over.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

As my very first compose app I'm already happy that something like this can be build in such a short time.
Time to dive deeper into Compose and build amazing stuff
